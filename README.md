 ### Data sources
 ---

*Company  Data  ,the dataset use for this analysis is from the factOrder csv file and other dimension tables . we have data on cost, units , quantity ,revenue ...*

### Tools
---
  - Excel 
  - Tableau

### Preparation
---
  -Fact table : factOrder
	-Dimension tables : dimCustomer , dimLocation , dimPayment , dimProduct , dimPromo , dimShipping

 	All the Dimension tables  has been joint to Fact table  using relationships instead and not joins

 	The performance/cardinality options between Fact table and Dimension tables are many(Fact table) to one ( Dimension tables )

 	The referential integrity  options between Fact table  and Dimension tables are   "all records match(Fact table)" and "all records match ( Dimension tables )" .But for the relationship between   Fact table and the dimPromo  table is  "some records match(Fact table)" and "all records match ( dimPromo  )" , as not all orderId  had a discount/ promo .

  To build our analyse E-Commerce performance dashboard , we need to compute the following metrics

		*Profit :: SUM([Revenue])- SUM([Cost])
		*Gross Revenue :: SUM([Revenue])
		*Profit Margin %:: [Profit]/[Gross Revenue]
		*Profit Margin % â€“ Row Level :: ([Revenue] - [Cost]) / [Revenue]
		*Discount :: SUM([Base Revenue])-[Gross Revenue]
		*Quantity :: SUM([Quantity])
		*Units  :: SUM([Units])
		*DISTINCT COUNT of OrderID :: COUNTD([Order ID])   
		*DISTINCT COUNT of Customers  :: COUNTD([CustomerId])
		*AVERAGE Order Value ::  [Gross Revenue]/[Order Count]

  Dashboard 1 - To build the High Level Performance Dashboard : I have created the below charts
		* Line chart
		* Bar chart
		* Scatter chart
		* Bans
